    "Companies and governments are facing increasingly complex and intricated problems that require rigorous assessment and monitoring, something that can be be accomplished through the use of mathemtical tools such as, for example, linear programming techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world, competitiveness and productivity are of paramount importance when comparing businesses, estimating their revenue and determining their solvency. Many companies and governments are lagging behind in the implementation of rational, quantitative solutions that would otherwise enable them to enact the necessary measures to achieve their objectives; we need not to look any further than the report *Key factors behind productivity trends in euro area countries* released by the European Central Bank which states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Productivity, defined broadly as efficiency in production, plays a key role in the economic resilience and social welfare of countries. Productivity growth influences the economy in important ways, affecting key variables such as output, employment and wages. Productivity is also relevant for monetary policy as it is a fundamental determinant of potential output growth and the natural rate of interest and, therefore, of the monetary policy space needed to deliver price stability over the medium term. As such, changes in productivity can influence the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and should be closely monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "and:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [...] aggregate labour productivity growth has been trending downwards for decades, both in the euro area and in other major economies. Average annual growth in labour productivity – measured as real GDP per hour worked – in those euro area countries that have sufficiently long time series has continuously declined from about 7% in the 1960s to just 1% since the early 2000s [...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Project management is not the only ingredient in the recipe for productivity and efficiency but it is nonetheless an important factor that has the potential of drastically improving these indicators and eliminating removable bottlenecks caused by suboptimal planning policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article published by the Harvard Business Review Editors named *The Four Phases of Project Managament* argues that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [...] Many projects fail either because they bite off more than they can chew and thus grossly underestimate time and money or because a significant part of the problem has been overlooked. [...] Ask, \"What will have to be done in order to accomplish X?\". [...] Estimate how long it will take to complete these tasks and how much tey will cost in terms of dollars and person-hours. As a result of your thoughtful planning [...] you'll also have a good idea of how long the project will take.\n",
    "\n",
    "HBR further elaborate that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> [...] most projects come with fixed beginning and end dates, regardless of available resources. To create a realistic schedule within those constraints, work backward from any drop-dead deadlines you know about- that is, dates that cannot be changed- to see when your deliverables must be ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business ought not to indulge in wishful thinking but instead focus on a rational allocation of capital, human resources and, crucially, time. For a comprehensive review of the impact of project management on productivity, refer to this report, published by the Association for Project Management, a British chartered professional organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another article, by EY's Oceania Business Transformation Leader, Loretta Hudson, states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our research shows that miners that invest in the right project management capabilities and toolsets can reap between 1% and 30% of project value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bertsekas' book briefly mentions an example corresponding to the subject of Project Management (vide p.54) but does not elaborate any further on the matter. After doing some research on the subject, I discovered that network linear programming may be used to solve problems related with the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "While CPM/PERT and its derivative models do not cover or take into account all the factors involved in project management, they do provide useful insight into the dynamics of the problem to be addressed; accordingly, CPM was developed at DuPont and Remigton Rand in 1950s and PERT was designed by the United States Navy at the same period. These techniques represented a significant leap into modern project management with respect to other tools, such as Gantt charts.\n",

These approaches (the heuristic or hand-calculated), however, have serious limitations as they cannot be accomodate for larger projects, which mean that their solutions are far from being optimal and cannot therefore, be deemed to be fit for optimization."
