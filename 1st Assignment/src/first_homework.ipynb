    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be stated that the role of healthcare is increasingly important in our society as it ages and new treatments are developed by scientists to prevent, cure or mitigate diseases. Sometime during 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged, roughly one hundred years later than the 1918 influeza pandemic, spreading throughout the world and wreacking havoc on communities and testing the ability of the healthcare system to resist such challenges. Hospitals in Spain and all over the world were quick to adapt their processes to this threat and increased their capabilities by expanding the number of beds available and that of the medical staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have been studying bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae and animals looking for potential pathogenic beings and vectors so as to monitor them and advise national and international health agencies. Therefore, the possibility of another outbreak cannot be dismissed and healthcare providers should be prepared for such events and have concrete and efficient contingency plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important problem that might be addressed using linear programming tools is the allocation of resources, staff and beds to patients, especially during the course of the acute phase of a pandemic. This is particularly relevant for healthcare providers as they have limited resources on which many lives depend upon.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the discrete case we will be employing binary variables to represent the scheduling problem that a hospital manager may be interested in solving in order to best respond to a disease outbreak by providing the best medical care in term of Intensivist-to-Patient ratios and medical staff work safety, namely in the case of rest hours as mandated by European and Spanish law. Unlike the continous case, we will be enforcing these restrictions through explicit constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective fucntion will be very similar as we strive minimze the difference between the actual Intensivist-to-Patient ratio and the optimal one as determined by the Spanish Health Ministry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except when noted, the general conditions that were laid out in the continuous case still hold true for the discrete one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our model will try to minimize the difference between the actual Intensivist-to-Patient ratio and the optimal one that is defined by the Spanish Ministry of Health. This will be achieved by assigning a variable number $x$ of physicians to a given turn for either the Infectious Section and the Non-Infectious Section of the UCI. This model would be of use in the first week of the outbreak where new physicians have not arrived yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better accomodate this problem, the two daily shift per scenario were chosen to last 12 hours each, as a sensible compromise between the 10 hour and 14 hour duration of the morning and evening shifts, respectively, set by the Spanish Health Ministry guidelines. It is worth noting that these twelve hour shifts include the necessary breaks for rest and food.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike in the previous case where the shift and level information were squashed so as to be able to represent the problem in a 2D manner with a matrix, this will not be possible in this instance.\n",

[<a href=\"#2003/88/CE\">6</a>] The maximum weekly work hours were chosen for this optimization problem are they refer to a unique week during an epidemic outbreak and it includes the on duty shift that physicians usually take (except when they have a certain age or health conditions)."
