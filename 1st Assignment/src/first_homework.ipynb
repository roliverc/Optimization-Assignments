    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be stated that the role of healthcare is increasingly important in our society as it ages and new treatments are developed by scientists to prevent, cure or mitigate diseases. Sometime during 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged, roughly one hundred years later than the 1918 influeza pandemic, spreading throughout the world and wreacking havoc on communities and testing the ability of the healthcare system to resist such challenges. Hospitals in Spain and all over the world were quick to adapt their processes to this threat and increased their capabilities by expanding the number of beds available and that of the medical staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have been studying bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae and animals looking for potential pathogenic beings and vectors so as to monitor them and advise national and international health agencies. Therefore, the possibility of another outbreak cannot be dismissed and healthcare providers should be prepared for such events and have concrete and efficient contingency plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important problem that might be addressed using linear programming tools is the allocation of resources, staff and beds to patients, especially during the course of the acute phase of a pandemic. This is particularly relevant for healthcare providers as they have limited resources on which many lives depend upon.\n"
