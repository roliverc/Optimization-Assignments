    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be stated that the role of healthcare is increasingly important in our society as it ages and new treatments are developed by scientists to prevent, cure or mitigate diseases. Sometime during 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged, roughly one hundred years later than the 1918 influenza pandemic, spreading throughout the world and wreacking havoc on communities and testing the ability of the healthcare system to resist such challenges. Hospitals in Spain and all over the world were quick to adapt their processes to this threat and increased their capabilities by expanding the number of beds available and that of the medical staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have been studying bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae and animals looking for potential pathogenic beings and vectors so as to monitor them and advise national and international health agencies. Therefore, the possibility of another outbreak cannot be dismissed and healthcare providers should be prepared for such events and have concrete and efficient contingency plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important problem that might be addressed using linear programming tools is the allocation of resources, staff and beds to patients, especially during the course of the acute phase of a pandemic. This is particularly relevant for healthcare providers as they have limited resources on which many lives depend upon.\n"

These values are not useful alone, but they do make sense when paired with the results for other turns that take place at the same time slot. In a moment when resources are critically scarce, it may be useful to employ a doctor that is already working in another concurrent scenario; for example, in two concurrent scenarios, A with result 1.8 and B with result 0.8, it may be interpreted that a doctor assigned in B could devote 20% of its efforts in helping his/her fellow doctors in scenario A where there is tighter need for 2 doctors rather than only one.\n",

It is clear however that for a number of variables of 84, this cumulative deviation is not very significant as we are sure that there is basic minimum ratio that is assured through the constraints."

Unlike the continous case, we will be enforcing these restrictions through explicit constraints.\n",

    "The discrete with 2016 variables and 552 constraints is best suited to solve this scheduling problem. It is the one that gives the most important information to the health manager as it not only provides the total number of physicians that are needed in each turn per day, but it designs the schedule of each one of the doctors straight away considering all the considerations that were sent to the optimizer. By combining the information given by the discrete model and the superficial but useful insight provided by the continuous one regarding the number of necessary physicians, the scheduling problem is well-covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the value taken by the objective function is -2.5834802800212016 which means (by the mathematical definition of the objective function provided previously) that the medical staff is being stretched thin by the number of patients and that - cumulatively - there are no spare doctors, for this we would need a positive value of the objective function. It is, however, an improvement over the continuous model (due to the increased number of doctors, from 17 to 24). It is clear however that for a number of variables of 2016, this cumulative deviation is not very significant as we are sure that there is basic minimum ratio that is assured through the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this discrete model is – predictably so – highly sparse, i.e., with many variables’ solution being 0 (Not present). Out of the 2016 solutions, only 94 were 1 (Present). This means that in many scenarios under dire circumstances and with scarce resources and under this number of patients, these scenarios are reasonably well-guarded by one doctor; this is not always the case, as some scenarios need more professionals, e.g., the case of shift [Fri, M2i] which is covered by doctors 6 and 19 or the case of [Thu,E1i] which is covered by doctors 7 and 12. This happens for other various scenarios."
