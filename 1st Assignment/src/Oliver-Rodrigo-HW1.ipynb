    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be stated that the role of healthcare is increasingly important in our society as it ages and new treatments are developed by scientists to prevent, cure or mitigate diseases. Sometime during 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged, roughly one hundred years later than the 1918 influenza pandemic, spreading throughout the world and wreacking havoc on communities and testing the ability of the healthcare system to resist such challenges. Hospitals in Spain and all over the world were quick to adapt their processes to this threat and increased their capabilities by expanding the number of beds available and that of the medical staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have been studying bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae and animals looking for potential pathogenic beings and vectors so as to monitor them and advise national and international health agencies. Therefore, the possibility of another outbreak cannot be dismissed and healthcare providers should be prepared for such events and have concrete and efficient contingency plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important problem that might be addressed using linear programming tools is the allocation of resources, staff and beds to patients, especially during the course of the acute phase of a pandemic. This is particularly relevant for healthcare providers as they have limited resources on which many lives depend upon.\n"

    "\n",
    "According to the website of the University Hospital Complex of Le칩n, the medical staff of its Intensive Medicine Unit is comprised by 7 physicians and 5 MIR trainees. [<a href=\"#jcyl-icu-profile\">2</a>]  For this model, 7 physicians plus 3 MIR trainees are considered - plus 7 reinforcements from other hospitals -, therefore amounting to 17 doctors (this information will be used in the Discrete version of the model more precisely). For the continuous version of the model it will be assumed that physicians are working the number of hours that is established by law.\n",

They thus yielded integer and non-integer results that can be interpreted, nonetheless. Why and how? \n",

    "This model is useful as it provides a simple enough overview of the scheduling problem in a quantitative fashion that would allow a hospital manager to have an idea of the number of physicians that should be in each scenario to improve the quality of medical care during an epidemic emergency when resources are especially scarce.\n",

    "Integer values are directly interpretable as a value of 2 is a clear indicator that 2 physicians are needed in that shift but, what about the non-integer values? These values are not useful alone, but they do make sense when paired with the results for other turns that take place at the same time slot. In a moment when resources are critically scarce, it may be useful to employ a doctor that is already working in another concurrent scenario; for example, in two concurrent scenarios, A with result 1.8 and B with result 0.8, it may be interpreted that a doctor assigned in B could devote 20% of its efforts in helping his/her fellow doctors in scenario A where there is tighter need for 2 doctors rather than only one.\n",

    "A particular example in the dataset is that (E3n, Tue) has a value of 0.5 and a concurrent scenario (E3i, Tue) has a value of 0.583. In this case, a single doctor would be better employed by assisting both areas half of the time; roughly 50%, 50% as it is per the results given by the optimizer. Other similar case arises throughout the solution set.\n",

    "We can see that the value taken by the objective function is -3.6380952380952394 which means (by the mathematical definition of the objective function provided previously) that the medical staff is being stretched thin by the number of patients and that - cumulatively - there are no spare doctors, for this we would need a positive value of the objective function. It is clear however that for a number of variables of 84, this cumulative deviation is not very significant as we are sure that there is basic minimum ratio that is assured through the constraints."

    "\n",
    "In the discrete case we will be employing binary variables to represent the scheduling problem that a hospital manager may be interested in solving in order to best respond to a disease outbreak by providing the best medical care in term of Intensivist-to-Patient ratios and medical staff work safety, namely in the case of rest hours as mandated by European and Spanish law. Unlike the continous case, we will be enforcing these restrictions through explicit constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective fucntion will be very similar as we strive minimze the difference between the actual Intensivist-to-Patient ratio and the optimal one as determined by the Spanish Health Ministry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except when noted, the general conditions that were laid out in the continuous case still hold true for the discrete one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the following three vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector of physicians (binary): $$\\vec{G} = (g_0, g_1, \\cdots, g_{P-1})$$\n",
    "- Vector of days of the week: $$\\vec{D} = (d_0, d_1, \\cdots, d_{M-1})$$\n",
    "- Vector of scenarios: $$\\vec{S} = (s_0, s_1, \\cdots, s_{N-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows from the initial problem formulation that $P = 17$, $M = 7$ and $N = 12$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 Specific conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will try to minimize the difference between the actual Intensivist-to-Patient ratio and the optimal one that is defined by the Spanish Ministry of Health. This will be achieved by assigning a variable number $x$ of physicians to a given turn for either the Infectious Section and the Non-Infectious Section of the UCI. This model would be of use in the first week of the outbreak where new physicians have not arrived yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better accomodate this problem, the two daily shift per scenario were chosen to last 12 hours each, as a sensible compromise between the 10 hour and 14 hour duration of the morning and evening shifts, respectively, set by the Spanish Health Ministry guidelines. It is worth noting that these twelve hour shifts include the necessary breaks for rest and food.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision variables $x_{i,j,k}$ will be representing whether a given physician $i$ is working at a given day $j$ and shift $k$ or not; it is a binary variable where $1$ indicates that the doctor is working and $0$ that he/she is resting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the results obtained in the first section with the continuous model, it is clear that the hospital is understaffed to face this more problematic disease outbreak and thus 24 physicians are considered to be available during that week (including reinforcements from other hospitals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in the previous case where the shift and level information were squashed so as to be able to represent the problem in a 2D manner with a matrix, this will not be possible in this instance.\n",

    "- Doctors will not work more than 48 hours per week, i.e, 4 shifts per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The resting time between two shifts is 12 hours, i.e., one shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the European Directive 2003/88/CE of November 4, 2003; a limit of 48 weekly work hours is established. [<a href=\"#2003/88/CE\">6</a>] The maximum weekly work hours were chosen for this optimization problem are they refer to a unique week during an epidemic outbreak and it includes the on duty shift that physicians usually take (except when they have a certain age or health conditions)."

    "The discrete with 2016 variables and 552 constraints is best suited to solve this scheduling problem. It is the one that gives the most important information to the health manager as it not only provides the total number of physicians that are needed in each turn per day, but it designs the schedule of each one of the doctors straight away considering all the considerations that were sent to the optimizer. By combining the information given by the discrete model and the superficial but useful insight provided by the continuous one regarding the number of necessary physicians, the scheduling problem is well-covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the value taken by the objective function is -2.5834802800212016 which means (by the mathematical definition of the objective function provided previously) that the medical staff is being stretched thin by the number of patients and that - cumulatively - there are no spare doctors, for this we would need a positive value of the objective function. It is, however, an improvement over the continuous model (due to the increased number of doctors, from 17 to 24). It is clear however that for a number of variables of 2016, this cumulative deviation is not very significant as we are sure that there is basic minimum ratio that is assured through the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this discrete model is  predictably so  highly sparse, i.e., with many variables solution being 0 (Not present). Out of the 2016 solutions, only 94 were 1 (Present). This means that in many scenarios under dire circumstances and with scarce resources and under this number of patients, these scenarios are reasonably well-guarded by one doctor; this is not always the case, as some scenarios need more professionals, e.g., the case of shift [Fri, M2i] which is covered by doctors 6 and 19 or the case of [Thu,E1i] which is covered by doctors 7 and 12. This happens for other various scenarios."
