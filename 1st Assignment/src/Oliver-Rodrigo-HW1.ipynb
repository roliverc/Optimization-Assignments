    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be stated that the role of healthcare is increasingly important in our society as it ages and new treatments are developed by scientists to prevent, cure or mitigate diseases. Sometime during 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged, roughly one hundred years later than the 1918 influenza pandemic, spreading throughout the world and wreacking havoc on communities and testing the ability of the healthcare system to resist such challenges. Hospitals in Spain and all over the world were quick to adapt their processes to this threat and increased their capabilities by expanding the number of beds available and that of the medical staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have been studying bacteria, viruses, fungi, amoebae and animals looking for potential pathogenic beings and vectors so as to monitor them and advise national and international health agencies. Therefore, the possibility of another outbreak cannot be dismissed and healthcare providers should be prepared for such events and have concrete and efficient contingency plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important problem that might be addressed using linear programming tools is the allocation of resources, staff and beds to patients, especially during the course of the acute phase of a pandemic. This is particularly relevant for healthcare providers as they have limited resources on which many lives depend upon.\n"

    "The largest number of ICU beds in the University Hospital Complex of Le칩n was recorded on February 5, 2021, numbering 80 of them. [<a href=\"#jcyl-icu-beds\">1</a>] This gives us an idea of the increase that would be needed in response to a disease outbreak, the double of the current number of ICU beds (53 as of October 9, 2022) was chosen for the modelling, that is, 106 beds.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the website of the University Hospital Complex of Le칩n, the medical staff of its Intensive Medicine Unit is comprised by 7 physicians and 5 MIR trainees. [<a href=\"#jcyl-icu-profile\">2</a>]  For this model, 7 physicians plus 3 MIR trainees are considered - plus 7 reinforcements from other hospitals -, therefore amounting to 17 doctors (this information will be used in the Discrete version of the model more precisely). For the continuous version of the model it will be assumed that physicians are working the number of hours that is established by law.\n",

    "The document *Unidad de cuidados intensivos: Est치ndares y Recomendaciones* authored by the Spanish Ministry of Health in 2010 establishes the following *assistential levels* (detailed here with some modifications): [<a href=\"#icu-levels\">3</a>]\n",

    "In the continuous variable, we had 84 variables and 91 constraints in total. The results for the 84 variables representing the number of physicians in each turn for a given day were allowed to fluctuate within the positive reals. They thus yielded integer and non-integer results that can be interpreted, nonetheless. Why and how? \n",

    "This model is useful as it provides a simple enough overview of the scheduling problem in a quantitative fashion that would allow a hospital manager to have an idea of the number of physicians that should be in each scenario to improve the quality of medical care during an epidemic emergency when resources are especially scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer values are directly interpretable as a value of 2 is a clear indicator that 2 physicians are needed in that shift but, what about the non-integer values? These values are not useful alone, but they do make sense when paired with the results for other turns that take place at the same time slot. In a moment when resources are critically scarce, it may be useful to employ a doctor that is already working in another concurrent scenario; for example, in two concurrent scenarios, A with result 1.8 and B with result 0.8, it may be interpreted that a doctor assigned in B could devote 20% of its efforts in helping his/her fellow doctors in scenario A where there is tighter need for 2 doctors rather than only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular example in the dataset is that (E3n, Tue) has a value of 0.5 and a concurrent scenario (E3i, Tue) has a value of 0.583. In this case, a single doctor would be better employed by assisting both areas half of the time; roughly 50%, 50% as it is per the results given by the optimizer. Other similar case arises throughout the solution set."

    "The discrete with 2016 variables and 552 constraints is best suited to solve this scheduling problem. It is the one that gives the most important information to the health manager as it not only provides the total number of physicians that are needed in each turn per day, but it designs the schedule of each one of the doctors straight away considering all the considerations that were sent to the optimizer. By combining the information given by the discrete model and the superficial but useful insight provided by the continuous one regarding the number of necessary physicians, the scheduling problem is well-covered.\n",

This means that in many scenarios under dire circumstances and with scarce resources and under this number of patients, these scenarios are reasonably well-guarded by one doctor; this is not always the case, as some scenarios need more professionals, e.g., the case of shift [Fri, M2i] which is covered by doctors 6 and 19 or the case of [Thu,E1i] which is covered by doctors 7 and 12. This happens for other various scenarios.\n"
